# PacMan_COAL
This repository contains code of Pac-Man Game in Assembly Language compatible with MASM615.

The goal of this project is to implement a classic Pac-Man game using Assembly
language (8086) in Visual Studio. The game consists of three levels, each with
unique features, challenges, and objectives. 

Players embark on their Pac-Man journey with three lives. Losing a life occurs when
Pac-Man collides with a ghost or faces specific challenges within the maze. The
inclusion of lives adds an extra layer of strategy, emphasizing the importance of
careful navigation and strategic use of power pellets. It includes the movement of the
player the movement of ghost i.e. ai movement.

Level 1: The Beginning

1. Maze Layout:
   
The first level introduces players to a straightforward maze layout characterized by simple paths
and walls. The maze is designed to be easily navigable, allowing players to familiarize themselves
with Pac-Man's movement dynamics.

2. Ghost Behavior:
   
Ghosts in this level exhibit basic behavior, primarily focusing on chasing Pac-Man. Their
movements are predictable, providing players with a manageable introduction to ghost interactions.

3. Objective:
   
The primary goal of Level 1 is for Pac-Man to collect all the dots scattered throughout the maze.
Unlike subsequent levels, there are no power pellets introduced at this stage, emphasizing the
fundamental mechanics of dot collection.

4. Lives:
   
Players begin their Pac-Man journey with three lives. Losing a life occurs when Pac-Man collides
with a ghost.

5. Level Design Rationale:
   
Level 1 serves as an introductory phase, allowing players to grasp the fundamental mechanics of
the game. The straightforward maze layout and basic ghost behavior provide a gentle learning
curve, setting the foundation for more complex challenges in the following levels.

Level 2: The Challenge

6. Maze Layout:
   
The second level ramps up the complexity with additional walls, paths, and strategically
placed fruit bonuses. The maze design requires players to navigate more carefully and
consider new challenges.

7. Ghost Behavior:

Ghosts in Level 2 exhibit more diverse behaviors, introducing the concept of cutting off Pac-
Man's path. Pinky, a new ghost, adds complexity by employing unpredictable movements and
ambushing strategies.

8. Objective:
   
In addition to collecting dots, Pac-Man must strategically eat fruit bonuses for extra points.
Power pellets are introduced, providing Pac-Man with the ability to temporarily eat ghosts.

9. Lives:
    
Players still start with three lives. Colliding with a ghost or facing specific challenges within
the maze results in the loss of a life.

10. Level Design Rationale:
    
Level 2 challenges players with a more intricate maze layout and varied ghost behaviors. The
introduction of power pellets adds a strategic layer to the game, requiring players to plan their
movements to maximize points. The inclusion of three lives continues to emphasize the importance
of careful navigation. In this Level there will addon ball upon eating which player will be able to
kill ghost and add some points on each killing and ghost revert back to its initial point. Remember
that these points are for some time i.e., when player eat that addon he/she will be able to kill only
for 20 secs.

Level 3: The Showdown

11. Maze Layout:
Level 3 reaches the pinnacle of complexity, featuring teleportation paths, hidden shortcuts,
and additional obstacles. The maze design demands advanced navigation skills from players.

12. Ghost Behavior:
Ghosts in Level 3 exhibit diverse and coordinated behaviors, making it significantly more
challenging for Pac-Man. Inky and Clyde, new ghosts, introduce unique and complex
strategies that require strategic planning from the player.

13. Objective:
Pac-Man faces the ultimate challenge, navigating a complex maze while collecting dots, eating
fruit, and avoiding advanced ghost behaviors. Higher point values are assigned for collecting
dots and eating ghosts. The level culminates in a showdown with a boss ghost with unique
behavior.

14. Lives:
Players still start with three lives. Losing a life occurs when Pac-Man collides with a ghost or
faces challenges within the maze.

15. Level Design Rationale:
Level 3 serves as the climax of the game, pushing players to their limits with intricate maze
layouts and advanced ghost behaviors. The introduction of a boss ghost adds a unique twist,
requiring players to adapt their strategies. The continued inclusion of three lives emphasizes
the ongoing challenge of avoiding ghosts and completing the game. In this level there will be
like cherry upon eating that we will be able to increase the player live by one.
